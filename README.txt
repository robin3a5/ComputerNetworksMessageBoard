Server instructions:

	To run the server, you'll need to have python installed. If you don't already, navigate to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download/install the latest version.
	Once that's installed, you can open up an administrator command prompt and change the directory to wherever the 'Proj2Server.py' script is located with cd.
	Finally, type 'python Proj2Server.py', and that should start up the server in the terminal.
